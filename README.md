# Hiking Trail App ((https://www.google.com))

This app was created using Google Maps API for map functionality, Foursquare API for location data and KnockoutJS to manage the MVVM architecture of the app.

## How to Run the App:

Download or clone this repository onto your local machine and open the **trails.html** file in your browser. Ignore the index.html file, it is simply being used as a workaround for hosting static applications on Heroku.

###### The app can be accessed [here](https://hiking-trails.herokuapp.com/).
